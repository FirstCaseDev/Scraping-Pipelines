INDU MALHOTRA, J. 

  

1. 

  The Government of Maharashtra issued a requisition on 02.06.2016 

to the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (“MPSC”) to conduct the 

Limited Departmental Competitive Examination(“LDCE”) for selection of 

candidates to the post of Police Sub Inspector. 

2. 

  The  Home  Department,  Government  of  Maharashtra  vide 

Government  Circular  dated  27.06.2016  notified  828  vacancies,  out  of 

which  642  were  from  the  open  category,  and  186  were  from  various 

reserved  categories, for promotion  to the post of Police  Sub-Inspector 

through the LDCE– 2016.  

3. 

  The  selection  was  governed  by  the  provisions  of  the  Police  Sub-

Inspector (Recruitment) Rules, 1995. The relevant Rules are extracted

shall be made in the ratio of 25:25:50. 
 
Rule 5: Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules, if in the opinion

nomination.” 
 

 

4. 

  The MPSC recommended the names of 828 candidates, out of which 

642  were  from  the  open  category,  who  had  secured  253  marks  and 

above; and 186 candidates were from the various reserved categories, 

who had secured 230 marks and above, on the basis of the corrected 

final result declared on 12.12.2017. 

5. 

  The  Home  Department,  Government  of  Maharashtra  vide  a 

Government  Resolution  No.  Police  -1818/  File  355/Pol  5A  dated 

22.04.2019  notified  that  the  Cabinet  had  taken  a  policy  decision  to 

accommodate  636  additional  candidates  who  had  secured  more  than 

230 marks in the LDCE – 2016 examination. 

6. 

  On 11.06.2019, the Directorate General of Police issued a direction 

for  conducting  the  medical  test  and  other  formalities  to  send  the 

additional  636  candidates  for  training  to  the  Maharashtra  Police 

Academy, Nasik, as a part of the process of their appointment to the post 

of Police Sub-Inspector. 

7. 

  The  Deputy  Secretary  of  the  MPSC  addressed  a  letter  dated 

11.07.2019  to  the  Additional  Chief  Secretary  (Appeal  and  Security) 

Government of Maharashtra wherein it was stated that as per Article 320 

of the Constitution, the MPSC has the power to appoint candidates to 

3 

 

 

 

various  posts  in  the  State.  The  post  of  Police  Sub-Inspector  being  a 

Class III post, was required to be filled up in accordance with The Police 

Sub-Inspector (Recruitment) Rules, 1995. The list of 636 additional was 

notified by the Government on its official website, had been done without 

consulting  the  MPSC,  which  was  a  serious  irregularity,  and  would 

hamper the functioning of the Commission.  

8. 

 

In the above background, various Original Applications were filed by 

candidates to challenge the Policy decision contained in the G.R. dated 

22.04.2019. In the present case O.A. No. 722 / 2019 was filed by a group 

of  In-service  candidates  who  were  working  as  Police  Constables,  and 

were aggrieved by the impugned G.R., since it would adversely affect 

their promotional prospects.  

  The Petitioners challenged the  G.R. dated 22.04.2019  inter alia on 

the ground that the additional 636 candidates who were directed to be 

accommodated to the post of Police Sub-Inspector, was contrary to the 

Recruitment Rules, and would have the inevitable effect of distorting the 

ratio for recruitment through the Limited Departmental Examination.  

  Rule  4  of  the  Police  Sub-Inspector  (Recruitment)  Rules,  1995 

provides a quota of 25% for promotion through the Local Departmental 

Examination. The appointment of 636 additional candidates would have 

the effect of distorting the quota of 25% prescribed by Rule 4, and curtail 

the future promotion opportunities of candidates who had either failed in 

the LDCE-2016, or who were not eligible on account of age, experience 

and educational qualification. The denial of promotional avenues to the 

 

4 

 

Petitioners in the foreseeable future would be violative of Articles 14 and 

16 of the Constitution of India. 

 

 

The  Maharashtra  Administrative  Tribunal  vide  interim  Order 

dated 18.10.2019 directed that Status Quo be maintained with respect 

to  the  636  additional  candidates  whose  list  was  appended  to  the 

Government  Resolution.  This  Order  was  passed  on  the  basis  of  an 

earlier  Order  dated  01.08.2019  passed  by  the  Principal  Bench  of  the 

Tribunal in O.A. No. 445 of 2019.  

9. 

   Respondents  No.  5  and  6  herein  filed  Misc.  Application  No.545  of 

2019  to  vacate  the  interim  Order  of  status  quo  dated  18.10.2019, 

wherein it was prayed that a direction be given to the State to proceed 

with the implementation of G.R. dated 22.04.2019.  

10. 

   The  Maharashtra  Administrative  Tribunal  vide  Order  dated 

30.11.2019 vacated the interim Order dated 18.10.2019 on the ground 

that two of the Petitioners had appeared in the LDCE exam, but failed to 

qualify  in  the  said  examination;  whilst  the  other  Petitioners  had  not 

participated in the exam. It was also held that the Petitioners had failed 

to  implead  the  636  additional  candidates  who  were  directed  to  be 

appointed under the impugned G.R., and were necessary parties to be 

impleaded in the O.A. Reliance was placed on the Order passed by the 

Bombay High Court in W.P. No. 3555/2019 Nivrathi Venkatrao Gitte v. 

State  of  Maharashtra,  wherein  the  same  G.R.  dated  22.04.2019  had 

been  challenged.  The  High  Court  had  directed  that  the  process  of 

selection  may  proceed,  but would be subject to  the results of the  Writ 

Petition. 

 

5 

11. 

  Aggrieved by the Order dated 30.11.2019, the  Original Applicants / 

Petitioners herein filed W.P. No. 15045 of 2019 before the Bombay High 

 

Court, Aurangabad Bench.  

  The Bombay High Court rejected the Writ Petition, and the prayer to 

maintain status quo with respect to the 636 additional candidates who 

were  directed  to  be  appointed.  The  High  Court  declined  to  determine 

whether  the  G.R.  dated  22.04.2019  had  been  issued  in  extraordinary 

circumstances  as  provided  by  Rule  5,  since  the  O.A.  was  pending 

adjudication  before  the  Tribunal.  The  High  Court  however  issued  a 

direction to the State Government to send the additional 636 candidates 

for the training of 9 months; and, requested the Tribunal to dispose of 

the pending O.A. within  the same  period, so that prior to  the posting / 

appointment orders being issued in favour of the additional candidates, 

the O.A. would be decided. 

12. 

  We  have  heard  Mr.  Vinay  Navare,  Senior  Advocate  for  the 

Appellants,  Mr.  Sachin  Patil,  Advocate-on-record  for  the  Respondent-

State of Maharashtra, Mr. Ravindra Adsure for the Caveators, and Mr. 

R. Basant, Senior Advocate and Mr. M. N. Rao, Senior Advocate for the 

Intervenors. With the consent of parties, we are disposing of the Appeal 

at the admission stage. 

13. 

  Article 320(3)(a) of the Constitution of India provides that the Union 

Public  Service  Commission,  or  the  State  Public  Service  Commission 

shall be  consulted on  all matters  relating to  methods of recruitment  to 

civil services, and for civil posts.  

 

6 

 

 

In the present case, we find that the State of Maharashtra has issued 

the impugned G.R. dated 22.04.2019, without any consultation or prior 

approval by the MPSC, which is evident from the letter dated 11.07.2019 

issued by the MPSC to the Government, expressing its disapproval of 

the  decision  taken  by  the  Government  unilaterally  to  make  these 

appointments without any consultation. 

14. 

  Rule  5  of  the  Police  Sub-Inspector  (Recruitment)  Rules,  1995 

provides that notwithstanding anything contained in these rules, if in the 

opinion of the Government, the exigencies of service require, the  ratio 

prescribed  for  appointment  by  promotion,  on  the  basis  of  Limited 

Departmental Examination or nomination, may be relaxed with the prior 

consultation of the Commission.  

  The Government would be required to establish before the Tribunal 

as to whether there were any extra-ordinary circumstances which have 

warranted the exercise of power under Rule 5, which may be resorted to 

only in rare and exceptional circumstances.  

15. 

  The impugned G.R. seeks to fill up double the number of vacancies 

which  were  notified  for  the  LCDE  –  2016  by  the  Circular  dated 

27.06.2016. It is well-settled in service jurisprudence that  the authority 

cannot fill up more than the notified number of vacancies advertised, as 

the recruitment of candidates in excess of the notified vacancies, would 

be violative of Articles 14 and 16 (1) of the Constitution of India. 

16. 

  The Tribunal has vacated the Order of status quo dated 18.10.2019, 

on  the  ground  that  two  of  the  Applicants  had  participated  in  the 

examination, but failed to qualify.  

7 

 

 

   This  could  not  be  a  justifiable  ground  to  vacate  the  interim  Order, 

since  the  promotional  prospects  of  the  Petitioners  would  be  seriously 

prejudiced,  since  a  block  of  636  additional  candidates  would  be 

appointed as Police Sub-Inspectors over and above the Applicants. 

17. 

       The  other  ground  on  which  the  Tribunal  has  vacated  the  Interim 

Order  is  stated  in  para  17  of  the  Order  that  the  Applicants  had  not 

challenged the G.R. dated 22.4.2019.  

   This  is  an  erroneous  observation  which  would  be  evident  from  the 

prayers in the O.A. which are set out hereunder for ready reference: - 

 

“(A)  Original  Application  may  kindly  be  allowed  by  directing  the 
Respondents  to  undertake  recruitment  strictly  as  per  PSI  Recruitment 
Rules, 1995, without any deviation therefrom 
 
(B) The recruitment by promotion of as many as 636 candidates sought to 
be made vide Govt. Resolution dated 22.4.2019, may kindly be quashed 
and set aside, the same being contrary to Recruitment Rules as well as 
binding precedent of the Hon’ble Apex Court. 
  
€ Pending hearing and final disposal of this Application, the Respondents 
No.1  to  3  may  kindly  be  directed  not  to  take  any  further  action  in 
furtherance of the impugned Govt. Resolution dated 22.4.2019. 
 
(D) Pending hearing and final disposal of this Application, the Respondents 
No.1 to may kindly be directed to maintain  status quo in respect of 636 
candidates  sought  to  be  appointed  by  promotion,  under  the  Impugned 
Govt. Resolution dated 22.4.2019. 
 
€ Any other suitable and equitable relief to which applicants are entitled to 
and this Hon’ble Tribunal deems appropriate, may kindly be granted in their 
favour.” 

(emphasis supplied) 

In  view  thereof,  the  said  observation  cannot  be  a  ground  for 

vacating  the  interim  order  of  stay  granted  vide  Order  dated 

 

  

18.10.2019. 

18. 

   The third ground on which the Tribunal has vacated the Interim Order 

was  that  in  similar  O.As  challenging  the  same  G.R.  dated  22.4.2019, 

 

8 

 

including  O.A.  No.  455  of  2019  filed  before  the  Principal  Bench,  the 

Applicants  in those cases  had withdrawn their respective cases,  since 

they  were  desirous  of  pursuing  their  representations  with  the  State 

Government.  

  This could also not be a justifiable ground for vacating the Order of 

status quo merely because other parties had chosen to withdraw their 

O.A. for their own reasons. 

19. 

  We find that the High Court in the present Writ Petition has issued a 

direction  to  the  State  to  send  the  additional  list  of  636  candidates  for 

training  of  9  months  during  the  pendency  of  proceedings  before  the 

Tribunal. 

challenge.  

   We  are  of  the  view  that  such  a  direction  ought  not  to  have  been 

passed  in  the  Writ  Petition  filed  by  the  present  Petitioners,  who  are 

aggrieved  by  the  impugned  Government  Resolution  No.  Police  -1818/ 

File  355/Pol  5A  dated  22.04.2019,  which  is  the  subject  matter  of 

20. 

 

In  view  of  the  discussion  hereinabove,  we  allow  the  present  Civil 

Appeal,  and  direct  that  Government  Resolution  No.  Police  -1818/  File 

355/Pol 5A dated 22.4.2019 will remain stayed during the pendency of 

proceedings before the Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal.   

  We set aside the Order dated 30.11.2019 passed by the Maharashtra 

Administrative Tribunal which vacated the interim Order 18.10.2019, and 

the Order dated 06.03.2020 passed by the Bombay High Court in W.P. 

No. 15045 / 2019. 

 

9 

21. 

  We direct the Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal, Nagpur Bench to 

 

decide the pending O.A. within a period of six months from the date of 

receipt  of  this  Order.  The  Tribunal  will  ensure  that  the  additional  636 

candidates  are  given  notice  of  the  pending  O.A.  through  the  State,  to 

enable them to appear and participate in the proceedings. The Tribunal 

is further directed to club all pending  Original Applications  challenging 

the impugned Government Resolution No. Police -1818/ File 355/Pol 5A, 

and pass a common Judgment in these cases.  

There will be no order as to costs. 

Pending applications, if any, are accordingly disposed of.
